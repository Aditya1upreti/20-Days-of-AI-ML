# Netflix Data Analysis & Machine Learning (Day 2)

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and baseline machine learning using a Netflix dataset.  
It is part of my personal **20 Days of AI/ML** learning challenge aimed at strengthening ML fundamentals through hands-on practice.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Understand and explore a real-world dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Build a baseline machine learning model
- Iteratively improve the model to observe performance changes

---

## 🧠 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the Netflix dataset
- Handled missing values and cleaned relevant features
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand patterns
- Built an initial machine learning model
- Improved the model through feature handling and tuning
- Evaluated results to understand model behavior

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Key Learnings
- Importance of EDA before modeling
- How data quality impacts model performance
- Difference between a baseline model and an improved model
- Rebuilding confidence with ML workflows and libraries
