# 🤖 Phase 4: AI Agents & Automation

The final phase focuses on making AI "do things." We transition from passive models to active agents that can browse, search, and automate tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Connect LLMs to external tools (Search, Browser, APIs).
- Build autonomous multi-step workflows.
- Use no-code/low-code tools (n8n) for production pipelines.

## ⚙️ Project List
- **Day 18:** AI Search Engine (Retrieval + LLM Synthesis)
- **Day 19:** Browser Automation & Market Analyst Agent
- **Day 20:** AI Newsletter Pipeline (Automated Content Curation with n8n)
